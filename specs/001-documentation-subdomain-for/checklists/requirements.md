# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Subdomain for 21.dev

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated against the specification:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses on user needs (developers accessing documentation, maintainers keeping it current) without specifying Swift, DocC, or GitHub Actions implementation details.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 19 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria use measurable metrics (load time, completion time, performance scores). No clarification markers remain - all 5 questions were answered by the user.

3. **Feature Readiness**: Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format. Success criteria map directly to user stories (SC-001 to US1, SC-004-006 to US2, etc.).

## Notes

- Multi-repository documentation limitation is appropriately documented in Future Considerations section
- Assumptions section clearly states dependencies on Dependabot, Cloudflare Pages capacity, and swift-secp256k1 documentation quality
- Edge cases cover failure scenarios, API changes, and concurrent updates
- Specification is ready to proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
