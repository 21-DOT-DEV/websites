# Production Release Checklist: Documentation Subdomain

**Feature**: Documentation Subdomain for 21.dev  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive production-level requirements validation across all critical paths (deployment safety, documentation accuracy, CI reliability)  
**Rigor Level**: Exhaustive - Production Release Gate

**CRITICAL**: This checklist validates **REQUIREMENTS QUALITY**, not implementation. Each item tests whether the spec/plan are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable.
