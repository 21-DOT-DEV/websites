- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (Updated after clarification session)

All checklist items validated successfully after /speckit.clarify workflow:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on LLM needs (accessing machine-readable documentation), documentation maintainer needs (automated updates), and reviewer needs (preview validation). No implementation details in user stories - all focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all 16 clarifying questions answered: 5 initial + 5 docs.21.dev learnings + 6 from /speckit.clarify session)
   - 41 functional requirements, all testable with clear MUST statements:
     * 31 original
     * FR-032 through FR-035 from docs.21.dev insights  
     * FR-036 (file splitting), FR-037 (format validation), FR-038 (size monitoring), FR-039 (version pinning), FR-040 (external indexes), FR-041 (root index.md) from clarification session
   - 10 success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-010)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "markdown files are valid", "2,500+ individual files")
   - 3 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (4 scenarios each)
   - 10 edge cases documented (6 original + 2 from docs.21.dev + 2 from clarification: split failures, delimiter format changes)
   - Scope bounded to swift-secp256k1 only, md.21.dev subdomain
   - 15 assumptions documented, including DocC4LLM format, version pinning, external indexes, and split processing

3. **Feature Readiness**: 
   - Each FR maps to user stories (FR-001-005 → US1, FR-011-019 → US2, FR-018/023 → US3)
   - User scenarios cover: LLM access (P1), automatic updates (P2), preview validation (P3)
   - Feature delivers on all success criteria (LLM-parseable markdown, automated sync, quality validation)
   - Specification stays at requirements level - mentions DocC4LLM and Cloudflare but as capabilities, not implementation

## Notes

- Specification acknowledges constitutional requirement (FR-029: DocC4LLM must be added as approved dependency)
- Future migration path to Swift plugin documented (FR-030, Assumptions)
- LLM optimization requirements clearly separated (FR-025-028) for implementation focus
- Edge cases address both generation failures and export failures, maintaining debuggability
- Specification ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

## Clarifications Captured

During specification development, **10 clarifying questions** were asked and answered in two phases:

### Initial Clarifications (Questions 1-5):
1. **Package Scope**: swift-secp256k1 only (matching docs.21.dev)
2. **Source Format**: Generate .doccarchive then use DocC4LLM to export markdown
3. **Target Audience**: LLMs primarily, optimized for AI consumption
4. **Update Frequency**: Synchronized with docs.21.dev (same triggers)
5. **Dependency Handling**: Add DocC4LLM as approved dependency, future Swift plugin migration

### Additional Clarifications Based on docs.21.dev Learnings (Questions 6-10):
6. **Artifact Packaging**: Upload markdown directory as-is; fallback to zipping if path issues occur (like docs.21.dev colons-in-filenames issue)
7. **Reusable Workflows**: Create generate-markdown.yml, reuse deploy-cloudflare.yml, orchestrate with MD-21-DEV.yml (mirrors docs.21.dev pattern)
8. **DocC4LLM Installation**: Add to Package.swift temporarily, invoke via `swift run docc4llm export` command
9. **Output Location**: ./Websites/md-21-dev/ (mirrors docs.21.dev structure)
10. **Archive Cleanup**: CI workspace auto-cleanup handles .doccarchive removal (no explicit deletion needed)

All answers incorporated into requirements:
- Initial: FR-001-003, FR-015, FR-025-028, FR-029-030
- docs.21.dev learnings: FR-032 (reusable workflows), FR-033 (artifact packaging), FR-034 (DocC4LLM installation), FR-035 (directory structure & cleanup)

### Lessons Applied from Feature 001 (docs.21.dev):
- Artifact path validation issues (colons in filenames) → Fallback zipping strategy
- Reusable workflow pattern (generate + deploy separation) → Consistent architecture
- CI workspace cleanup behavior → No explicit cleanup needed for intermediate artifacts
- Version extraction from Package.resolved → Consistent approach across both features
- 1-day artifact retention pattern → Applied to markdown artifacts

### Additional Clarifications from /speckit.clarify Session (Questions 11-16):
11. **DocC4LLM Version Management**: Pin to exact version for reproducible builds (FR-039)
12. **File Naming Convention**: Split concatenated output into individual symbol files (FR-036)
13. **Format Validation**: Validate delimiters before splitting (FR-037)
14. **Size Monitoring**: Monitor and warn but don't fail workflow (FR-038)
15. **Index File Strategy**: External indexes (llms.txt, agents.md) with root index.md (FR-040, FR-041)
16. **Logging Level**: Minimal logging with actionable error context (updated FR-022, SC-007)

All clarifications integrated into requirements, assumptions, and success criteria. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.
