Welcome to 21.dev! We're an open-source organization working toward nonprofit status, focused on building practical tools for Bitcoin developers.

## Our mission

Right now, non-custodial Bitcoin is harder to build than custodial solutions. Multiple points of friction push developers toward centralized solutions, making users reliant on corporations. This essentially turns Bitcoin back into using centralized intermediaries, like a bank. We're working to fix that by making the hard parts simple, so developers can focus on building great applications instead of wrestling with low-level primitives.

When it's easier to implement secure, client-side operations, more teams can build self-custody solutions directly using open protocols. This reduces reliance on  intermediaries and helps Bitcoin's decentralization.

## Our first project

**P256K** is our first step in tackling this problem. This package wraps [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) to simplify operations for Swift developers, making it easier to handle keys, signatures, and other cryptographic primitives. By removing this friction, we're making it easier for developers to build non-custodial applications for both Bitcoin and Nostr.

## What's next

We'll be sharing updates on our projects, insights from Bitcoin development, and resources to help developers build better applications. Our goal is to turn hard, low-level tasks into boring building blocks.

Let's make Bitcoin development simpler. The more straightforward the primitives, the more ambitious applications can be.
