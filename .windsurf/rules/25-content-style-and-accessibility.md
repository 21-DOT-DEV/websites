# Content Style and Accessibility

## Tone
- Use clear, concise language.
- For marketing pages: persuasive but honest tone.
- For docs/tutorials: instructional and precise.

## Accessibility
- All images require `alt` text.
- Ensure text has sufficient color contrast.
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately.

## Code Samples
- Provide complete, runnable examples where possible.
- Use correct syntax highlighting in Markdown and HTML.

## Links
- Descriptive link text; avoid “click here”.
- External links should open in a new tab where appropriate.
